- [higamaya.com](https://higamaya.com/) ([Repo](https://github.com/higamaya/higamaya.com))
- [chrome-web-store.higamaya.com](https://chrome-web-store.higamaya.com/) ([Repo](https://github.com/higamaya/chrome-web-store))

The source code is published under the MIT license, so you can use it as a template.

## Customize colors

Colors used in Minimal Hugo theme are defined in [`assets/scss/sakura.scss`](assets/scss/sakura.scss) using CSS variables. You can override these CSS variables in your website's style sheet to customize the colors.

Your website's style sheet must be specified in the Hugo's config file as follows.

- When using CSS:

  ```toml
  [params.theme.style]
  css = "css/style.css"

  ```

  `css/style.css` file should be placed in the `static` directory.

- When using Sass(SCSS):

  ```toml
  [params.theme.style.sass]
  source = "scss/style.scss"
  target = "css/style.css"

  ```

  `scss/style.scss` file should be placed in the `assets` directory.
  `css/style.css` will be generated by Hugo.
